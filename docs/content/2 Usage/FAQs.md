## Why is RAWRR not accessible from the cloud? 

For security reasons and with the intention of preserving the integrity of the information that the organization entrusts to the people in charge of the intervention, RAWRR is designed to be a program for local use. However, we do not rule out that in the future we may find other secure alternatives that allow managing RAWRR from the cloud. 

## Why is RAWRR not collaborative? 

RAWRR is not collaborative from the network as a consequence of not being available in the cloud, however, it is possible to make it collaborative through the import and export of the information that is loaded in each instance, sharing these files safely with other people involved in the security intervention if necessary. 

## When will RAWRR be available in other languages? 

It is scheduled to be available in Spanish in early 2022. If you want to collaborate with the translation into another language, you can write to us at rawrr@conexo.org. 

## How can I send RAWRR enhancement or recommendations to developers? 

You can write to us at rawrr@conexo.org. 

## How many organization interventions can be stored in RAWRR? 

RAWRR is designed to use one instance per organization. If you want to use the information of an organization as the base for a new intervention, we recommend that you export a file with the data from the RAWRR home and import it into a new instance. In this sense, to manage more than one organization you can use as many RAWRR instances as there are organizations and/or as many exported .bd files as there are organizations. 

## How can I register new events related to a past security intervention? 

At this time RAWRR does not have follow-up functions after the initial security intervention, however, we are developing those new functionalities so that they will be available in 2022. In the meantime, if you have the previously exported .bd file of a previous intervention, you can use it as a basis for making follow up adjustments. 

## Which measures should I take to secure the information Iâ€™ll be storing in RAWRR? 

We recommend you use RAWRR within an encrypted container like a virtual machine or encrypted volume.

## What are the plans to improve RAWRR in the short term? 

We are working towards a new version of RAWRR in 2022 that potentially has the following new features:

- Spanish version
- Visualization of the evolution over time by comparing the current state of the organization with past states
- Management of multiple organizations per instance
- Accessibility features
- Custom report sections
- Rich text editing
