Some basic notes related to the current status of the program appear on the RAWRR home screen and we invite you to send your comments and recommendations for improvements.

Additionally, three (3) buttons appear:

1. **Load test values:** When you open a new instance of RAWRR it will be empty, that is, without preloaded information for any of the sections. Use this button if you want to start using a RAWRR instance using the example values ​​per section.
2. **Export to file:** RAWRR is designed to handle one organization / intervention per instance. When you have finished uploading the information for an organization, or at any time you wish, you can export a file with the data you have uploaded so far as a backup or to be reused in another instance of RAWRR in the future. The exported file will have the extension .db.
3. **Import from file:** It is possible that a security intervention has several similarities with others that you have done in the past. To reuse the information or collaborate with another person, you can import a previously exported .bd file into a new RAWRR instance.

Then, you will be able to start loading/editing the information related to the security intervention that you are carrying out and RAWRR will help you with the generation of the recommendations report. Information can be loaded in any order, but the order suggested by the navigation bar is: assets, activities, threats, vulnerabilities, recommendations and report.
