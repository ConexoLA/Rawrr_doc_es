The main result of an evaluation and the most common way to communicate with the organization is usually through a report. You can create and customize one or more reports for different audiences, for example, create a report for the directors of the organization and another for the IT department with only the very technical and specific recommendations. The basic functions of RAWRR related to reports are:

## Create report

To create a report you must select which elements you want it to contain. When you open the Reports section you will find the screen divided into two sections. The one on the right will initially show all the elements, by section, that were loaded in that RAWRR instance. Those elements that you do not want to appear in the report can be removed one by one and will appear on the left side of the screen.

Content removal can be done in two ways. The first is to individually remove the elements of a section by clicking on the **"Remove"** button located to the right of each element.

The second is by clicking on the circular **“Remove all”** icon located to the right of each section title.

Additionally, to make it easier to view the contents of a report, you can use the arrow icons located to the right of the titles of each section to expand (**“Expand”**) or compress (**“Collapse”**) the content of each section.

You can also change the order in which each element in a section appears by clicking on the element you want to reorder and dragging it to the place you want. If you want to change the order of the sections, you can do so by clicking on the "=" symbol and dragging to the place you want.

## Export report

Once you have selected the contents that you want the report to have, you can export it by clicking on the "Export report" button located above and to the right of the reports section.

Next, select the format in which you want to export, and in your operating system's dialog, select the name and the desired location for the report.
