One of the main goals of the assessment is to produce recommendations that will hopefully have a positive impact on the security of the organization. During this step, those recommendations will be specified and linked to vulnerabilities. The basic functions of RAWRR related to recommendations are:

## View list of recommendations

If you have started RAWRR by importing a file or loading the test values, it is convenient that you can carefully review the preloaded information before creating or editing any element. To see the complete list of recommendations you can click on "All" in the lower right next to the phrase "Rows per page". You can also select to view five (5), ten (10), or fifteen (15) items per page.

## Create recommendations

To add recommendations click on **"Add new"** top left and complete the fields that appear on the form: name, description, vulnerabilities, implementation cost and implementation time.

Normally the recommendations will be aimed at mitigating a vulnerability present in the organization. The “Vulnerabilities” list allows you to associate a recommendation with a vulnerability.
